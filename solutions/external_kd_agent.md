# External Knowledge – Let’s create an “Microsoft Surface Documentation“ Agent in Agent Builder

Create an agent at [microsoft365.com/chat](https://microsoft365.com/chat) with the following details:

**Name**: Microsoft Surface Documentation

**Purpose**: Answer Microsoft Surface product related questions based on the Microsoft Learn public website only.

Add the public website [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/) as knowledge and enable „Web search“

Test your agent by for example asking „What versions of the Surface Laptop 7 exist?“

Feel free to play with the instructions to get more out of it!

Bonus Task: Use Copilot / visual creator to create a logo for your agent!
